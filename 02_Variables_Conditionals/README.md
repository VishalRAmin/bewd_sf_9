#####Bonus resources to make your coding life easier:
* Interactive Try Git - https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git
* [Recommended] Ugly pry got you down? Check out https://github.com/kyrylo/pry-theme
    * `gem install pry-theme`
    * You might have to create the .pryrc file with `atom ~/.pryrc`
    * Pick a theme you like, and add it to your .pryrc file with `Pry.config.theme = "theme-name"`
